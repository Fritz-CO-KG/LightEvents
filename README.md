## Installation
Bingo plugin written in python for minecraft servers

Instructions on how to install:

1. Download the correct Jython version under                                              search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-standalone/2.7.0/jython-standalone-2.7.0.jar                      Then rename the downloaded file to jython.jar and put it into the minecraft servers folder. Create a new folder called "lib" inside of you minecraft server's folder and put the jython.jar inside of it.

2. Download pploader v.1.2.0                                                                                                    I could only find one source for this file:                                                                     https://www.daniel-braun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pploader1.2.0.zip                                                   extract the contents and put pploader.jar into your server's plugin files.

3. Download the latest release
4. Unzip it inside of your plugins directory, there should be a folder called "lightevents.py.dir"

## Self-check: 
The plugin should work IF:
1. Inside of your minecraft-server folder there are these sub-folders:
2. /lib with jython.jar
3. /plugin/lightevents.py.dir with (needed) plugin.py, plugin.yml, sources (with presets.json). (There might also be some other files, you don't have to delete them.)
